# Wiseoldman_API_CSharp

Wiseoldman_API_CSharp is a command-line interface (CLI) application developed in C#. Its purpose and functionalities are to work with data from https://wiseoldman.net/.
There are currently several generic classes & methods in development that allows this API to seamlessly work with the Wiseoldman API as a 3rd-party package.
All PR's are open if anyone has things they want to implement/lack of functionality.

The project file & DLL's will not be renamed so they will stay with the old version names for simplicity, but the package will from 04.10.25 be ranamed "Wiseoldman_API_CSharp"
